                <hr>
                <p>I was born to be an entrpreneur. My whole life I've always found a way to make my own money . I took my hustling to a new level when I started my math tutoring business. I started reading a lot of entrpreneurship books to find out what I needed to do to have a succesful business. During that time was when I figured out I needed a website more than anything else. So I created my own website using Wordpress and I started receiving tons of emails since. Lastly, I  learned that if I could code websites from scratch I would make big money and thats where it all started.  </p>
                <p>First things first, I've been into coding for about three months now. It's really becoming like second nature to me. I can code in languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Little do you know I wasn't really interested in the tech industry until I found out how much money was behind it. My father tried to get me to start coding years ago which I thought was prettty boring. I've met so many people who know how to code and that is what changed my point of view on programming. Now, that I'm highly interested in computer programming I plan to major in Computer Science. All in all, with a Computer Science degree and skills/experience in coding I can get a job anywhere!</p>

                            I've always doubted coding my whole life until now. Just by looking at all the different tags (which I didn't know were tags until now) intimidated me. Now that I consider myself as a programmer code is like speaking English to  me. Have you ever thought about doing something then changed your mind because of what you saw or heard about it? Well, we all have and making inferences is not always the best thing to do. New oportunities open up gates to places you've never been and places you've would've never thought you would be. It is great to have exposure and gain skills in different fields. With that being said go try something new like learning to code.

                            There are old millionaires and young millionaires. I actually love the fact that Aaliyah made the song "Age Ain't Nothing But A Number" because  its really not. Think about it, no matter how old you are you can still go after your dreams and become successful. Anybody can have a idea and become  a millionaire. Its just better to start young because you have more time and less responsibility.

                                You dont necessarily have to change your whole lifestyle, but you should should change the way you think. Many people underestimate theirselves because they have a fixed mindet which only highlights their basic qualities. There is so much you have to offer that you'll probably will nver know until you change your mindset from fixed to a growth mindset. People with growth mindsets are usually more dedicated and hard workers. Of course people who work hard are always successful with whatever they do.
